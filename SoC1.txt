Enjoy!

                          How would they proceed?

Piper - Thankfully, they each had a special, unique skillset lying in wait beneath the surface, waiting to come out. They were novice coders, and by their powers combined, they would be able to defeat the infamous GitHub...

Stefan - (stefankudev) - So they embarked together on their amazing journey, and within no time, they were already making sound progress on defeating GitHub!
